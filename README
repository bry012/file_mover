FILE MOVER

This relatively simple python program easily moves multiple selected file types
from and to diretories of choice. Features include simple copy along with copy+remove 
copied files from source directory. Multiple file types can be selected by separating 
each file type with a comma ",". File types can be excluded by preceding a file type with a "-".

ex.
<code>.mp3,.m4a,.jpg</code>  - all files with these extensions will be included
<code>.mp3,-.m4a,-.jpg</code> - all files with these extensions will be excluded

This program also creates a database on the user's machine
named "file_mover.db.

Version info:

Installation:

tkinter are installed on your machine.
